# Homework #2

## 1)
This week was largely dedicated to downloading and installing the appropriate user environment for this class.
We installed:
1. a **text editor** to write code, and
2. a desktop application for **Github** to allow us to collaborate, and gain experience with the site.
- We also learned the basics of *Markdown*.

## 2)
The assignment involved downloading several desktop applications we will use throughout the course.

## 3)
I had no real issues with this assigment, except that I couldn't figure out how to make the code on the MART120 wrap, which was a bit inconvenient.

## 4)
Nothing in particular, except to say I am excited to get my hands dirty with [Github](github.com). I've used it in several classes, but never really understood what was going on. This assingment helped clarify things.

## 5)
I have not yet, but we're still early in the cycle.
